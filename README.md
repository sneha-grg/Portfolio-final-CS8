# Portfolio-final-CS8

This portfolio represents the culmination of CS3A under the guidance of Professor Dave. 
It encompasses the range of SFML assignments completed over the course of the semester, 
some of which have been previously shared on GitHub. Once the program is initiated, 
navigation between slides is facilitated using the arrow keys. Each slide's application 
can be executed by specific keyboard inputs. For instance, the initial slide featuring a 
green circle responds to the 'G' key; subsequent slides include a bouncing ball ('B'), 
Pong ('P'), TopHatGuy ('T'), draw poker card ('D'), and poker analysis ('A'). These 
instructions are operationalized within the 'isKeyPressed()' function, detailed within 
'Window.cpp'. Should a return to the main menu be desired, it can be accomplished by 
holding the 'Q' key followed by 'M'.
